Some examples and exercises to help you get used to functions that return DOM Elements. It's highly recommended that you study the examples before diving into the exercises.  You just might find some useful code for the exercises ;)  And don't forget to use your inspector, these are DOM exercises after all!

At first just studying the examples may be a bit overwhelming.  It's supposed to be that way!  These exercises aren't only meant for practice writing DOM components but also for practicing inspecting the DOM, debugging your growing projects, and interpreting test results.

> PS.  it's worth studying the [DOM manipulation](../dom-manipulation) exercises before studying these.
